**`Aspiring Python Developer`**

I'm a bootcamp graduate specializing in Python and SQL that is currently seeking a junior position as a software engineer. I spend most of my days teaching myself new coding languages and planning future projects to build. A lifelong learner and hard worker I always approach everything I do with 110%. Currently I am spending my time teaching myself Javascript.

 <summary><h3>My journey so far</h3></summary>
  From a young age, I always had a strong interest in computers, especially the software side. I would spend most of my free time on a computer, tinkering with it for as long as my parents would allow. As a high school student, I took every single software class my school offered, but felt I should take my life in the biomedical engineering direction. During my time in school, I realized this was not what I wanted my future to be. After spending time in New York performing home automation installations, I started my position at Lincoln Technical Institute. I spent most of my days working with huge amounts of data that needed to be presented in clear and concise reports, and this is what reignited my passion for coding. I sought ways to automate, simplify, and expedite tasks for myself and my colleges using scripts. After a few months, I took the leap and enrolled in a coding bootcamp, determined to change my life and build meaningful things that help the people around me. Through working overtime, commuting 2 hours each day, and even having to move across the country halfway through my bootcamp, I persevered and graduated a straight A student. Of course, this is still only the beginning, and I intend to learn and grow as much as I can every single day.
