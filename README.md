**`Aspiring Python Developer`**

I'm a bootcamp graduate specializing in Python and SQL that is currently seeking a junior position as a software engineer. I spend most of my days teaching myself new coding languages and planning future projects to build. A lifelong learner and hard worker I always approach everything I do with 110%. Currently I am spending my time teaching myself Javascript.
